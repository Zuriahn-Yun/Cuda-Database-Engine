# Questions
What will the GPU do better than the CPU since it has thousands of threads. \
How can we optimize the GPU to use all of its threads to move and store data as quickly as possible? \
Do we still want to employ the CPU in order to do some tasks that require threads that move much quicker? Or do we only want to use the GPU?
