# Initial Questions
What is a Database Engine? 
    A database system handles Disk storage
    Data Retrieval 
    CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
What do I need to know? 
    C++
    Multithreading
    Cache Behavior
    Database fundamentals
    GPU and Cuda Fundamentals
    GPU Memory Architecture

What is a Database engine going to do? 
What version of Cuda will I be writting in?
How do we store Pictures? 
How is a Cuda Database enginer better than a CPU based Database engine? 
When we insert into our database how is storage being handled? Have we pre allocated a certain amount have we computed how much we will need in addition to some?
How does GPU make adding,moving,delting and mainly finding data quicker?
