What is Columnar Storage?

Tradional databases use Row based storage, all data for each person is stored in one block of memory.

In columnar storage Format you store all the names togheter in one block, all the ages togheter and all the ids togheter. 

So thread 1 grabs age 1, thread 2 grabs age 2 and so on and so on.
